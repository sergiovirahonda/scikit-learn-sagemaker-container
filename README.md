# scikit-learn-sagemaker-container
This project is about making things simpler when deploying custom models to SageMaker through ECR. Instead of using the suggested AWS template, I've followed the AWS suggestions to build a container fully compatible with ECR, but made simple. As you may guest, it follows the same structure that AWS asks, but the training process is made in a very simple way. For now it contains a vectorizer and a SVC model to inference wheter or not an email body is Spam or not.
